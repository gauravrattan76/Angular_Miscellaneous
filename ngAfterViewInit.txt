ngAfterViewInIt-
____________________________________________________

ngAfterViewInit() should be called after a component's view, and its children's views, are created. I tested this, and found that children's ngAfterViewInit()s are called before the parent's ngAfterViewInit().


Content is what is passed as children. View is the template of the current component.

The view is initialized before the content and ngAfterViewInit() is therefore called before ngAfterContentInit().
