Ng-content and content-projection-


In Angular, content projection is used to project content in a component. Let’s take a closer look at how it works:

Content projection allows you to insert a shadow DOM in your component. To put it simply, if you want to insert HTML elements or other components in a component, then you do that using the concept of content projection. In Angular, you achieve content projection using < ng-content >< /ng-content >.  You can make reusable components and scalable applications by properly using content projection.

<div class="card">
    <div class="card-header">
    <div class="card-title">Welcome to GMAS</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
  <ng-content class=".body"></ng-content>
    </div>
    <div class="card-footer">
            <ng-content class=".footer"></ng-content>
    This is the application Footer.
    </div>
    </div>

Content projection is very useful to insert shadow DOM in your components. To insert HTML elements or other components in a component, you need to use content projection. In AngularJS 1.X, content projection was achieved using Transclusion, however, in Angular, it is achieved using <ng-content>.
